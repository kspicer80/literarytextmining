# (1C) *Practicum*:

## Follow the maze!

You see before you three "mazes," each of which is a folder. Inside each of these maze-folders are an unknown number of other folders, as well as, somewhere, a file called "finish.txt". Use `cd` and `ls` to navigate through each maze, like we learned in our module, [(1C) The Terminal](01C_the_terminal).  When you find "finish.txt", print out its contents using `cat.`

We'll do the first maze together. The second and third will be done on your own, in class or at home, time depending.

The final assignment is to paste the contents of maze3's "finish.txt" into Canvas.
