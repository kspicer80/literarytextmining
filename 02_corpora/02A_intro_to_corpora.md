# (2A) Introduction to corpora

## What is a corpus?

Taken from the Latin for "body," a "corpus" [originally meant](http://www.oed.com.stanford.idm.oclc.org/view/Entry/41873?redirectedFrom=corpus#eid) the "body of a man or animal" (1440); in 1728 we find its literary meaning, as "the whole body of literature on any subject"; and by 1956 its linguistic one, as "body of written or spoken material upon which a linguistic analysis is based." 

Today, a [corpus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_corpus) is a structured set of texts, and [corpus linguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpus_linguistics) is the empirical study of real-world language, whether written or spoken, as collected into corpora.

A corpus is more than the sum of its parts: it not only includes texts but also knows something about them. In other words, it combines text data with **metadata**: data about data.

## Examples

### The Brown Corpus

Developed in 1961 at Brown University, the [Brown Corpus of Standard American English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_Corpus) is the [first](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/linguistics/external/clmt/w3c/corpus_ling/content/corpora/list/private/brown/brown.html) digital linguistic corpus. It is extremely well-studied and still in use today. Compilers Henry Kuƒçera and W. Nelson Francis subjected the corpus to a variety of computational analyses before publishing their results in *Computational Analysis of Present-Day American English* (1967), a foundational text in the discipline of corpus linguistics.

The Brown corpus includes 500 texts, each of which around 2,000 words, for a total of [one million words](https://gph.is/1sV3uRP). These 500 texts were divided into 15 categories:




## Our Class Corpora

### 1) The 49 Chapters of Karen Yei Tamashita's *Tropic of Orange* (1997)

### 2) Literature and Language in the 1990s

## Corpus Design

### Philosophy

What kind of meaning does a corpus have? Is there intentionality to its design? What can we say of a corpus like "All Short Stories published in the *New Yorker*" that we can't say of a corpus like "One Hundred Short Stories I Found By Googling"? (If you're interested, for more on these questions see Katherine Bode's recent article, ["The Equivalence of Close and Distant Reading"](https://read-dukeupress-edu.stanford.idm.oclc.org/modern-language-quarterly/article/78/1/77/19924/The-Equivalence-of-Close-And-Distant-Reading-Or), which makes a strong case for taking these questions extremely seriously.)

### Politics

Can a corpus be feminist? Can it be misogynist? How do we respond to issues of representation in corpus design? Constructing corpora is a social and political act.
